# State Capacity in Innovation

My Applied Economics Term paper. I have uploaded both the jupyter notebook file used to create the network and extract the network statistics.
Instructions for recreating the data set are included in the file.

Secondly the Stata .do file which includes all the data analysis and regression models used in the term paper.

To recreate the regression results and histograms use the State Capacity Data Set uploaded here.
